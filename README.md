# CVcompliance
WCAG compliance plugin for Chrome based on aXe core accessibility engine.  The original of the plugin communicated with a server for recording audit results on the fly for use in reports and UI fix tracking.  That functionality has temporarily been removed to make the plugin a stand-alone feature.
